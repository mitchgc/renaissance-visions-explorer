**Choices in Community**

Choices in Community Living (CiCL) is an exciting alternative for individuals with high and complex disability needs currently living in a Residential Service. CiCL is designed to give more choice and control to individuals and families around supports and services.

**Supported Living Overview**

Supported Living is a preferred option for individuals with disabilities who want to live independently in the community, without 24/7 support. The service focuses on your goals and aspirations. The team at Renaissance will work with you to increase your independence and relationships in the community, striving towards the outcome of a safe and fulfilling life. Most communities have a wide variety of resources available to assist you, so establishing links into these local networks is an integral part of developing long term connections to strengthen your opportunities to participate in your community.

**Our Philosophy**

Living independently in the community can be challenging and a difficult decision to make for people with disabilities; and at Renaissance we also know that life is an amazing journey, and people should have the freedom to dream big, take risks, live life their way, and with the right support around you, anything is possible!

**Service Options**

At Renaissance Group, we aim to serve. If you have disability support budgets under Enabling Good Lives or Individualised Funding, you can access our range of service options.
